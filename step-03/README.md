# ![](/img/logo-25px.png) PWA Beers - Step 03 - A list of Beers

> This is an optional step, that helps you dive deeper into Polymer. If your main interest in *PWA Beers* is the PWA aspect, you can simply copy the content of the `step-03` folder into your working folder `app`.

In this step we are going to create a more complex Polymer element, a custom `beer-list`.
This element will use a JavaScript array as model and automatically generate a `beer-list-item` for each beer in the array.


## Creating the element file

We begin by creating a new file for the element, `./src/beer-lists/beer-list.html`. Inside it we put a basic Polymer element definition:


```html
<!-- Our beer-list will generate `beer-list-item` elements, so we import it -->
<link rel="import" href="./beer-list-item.html">

<dom-module id="beer-list">
  <template>
    <!-- local DOM for your element -->
    <style>
      /* CSS rules for your element */
    </style>
  </template>

  <script>
    // element registration
    Polymer({
      is: "beer-list",
      // add properties and methods on the element's prototype
      properties: {
      }
    });
  </script>
</dom-module>
```


## Defining the model

We are going to model our (ever growing) beer collection as a JavaScript array in our `beer-list` element.
We will use the element's `ready` function, a function that is called when the element has been loaded and instantiated, and that is often used to initialize variables.

```html
<script>
  // element registration
  Polymer({
    is: "beer-list",
    // add properties and methods on the element's prototype
    properties: {
      beers: {
        type: Array,
        // When initializing a property to an object or array value, use a function to ensure that each element
        // gets its own copy of the value, rather than having an object or array shared across all instances of the element
        value: function() { return []; }
      }
    },
    ready: function() {
      this.beers = [
        {
          alcohol: 8.5,
          name: "Affligem Tripel",
          description: "The king of the abbey beers. It is amber-gold and pours with a deep head and original aroma, delivering a complex, full bodied flavour. Pure enjoyment! Secondary fermentation in the bottle."
        },
        {
          alcohol: 9.2,
          name: "Rochefort 8",
          description: "A dry but rich flavoured beer with complex fruity and spicy flavours."
        },
        {
          alcohol: 7,
          name: "Chimay Rouge",
          description: "This Trappist beer possesses a beautiful coppery colour that makes it particularly attractive. Topped with a creamy head, it gives off a slight fruity apricot smell from the fermentation. The aroma felt in the mouth is a balance confirming the fruit nuances revealed to the sense of smell. This traditional Belgian beer is best savoured at cellar temperature "
        }
      ];
    }
  });
</script>
```

So now we have a `beers` property in our element, that can be access in the JS side using `this.beers` and in the `dom-model` side using  `{{beers}}`.

As you can see, for each beer we have the `name` and `description` properties that `beer-list-item` needs, and also added an `alcohol` property that our element isn't capable to use yet.


## Data-binding

A reasonable thing to do for our `beer-list` would be to spawn a `beer-list-element` for each beer in the `beers` array. How can we do that? By using Polymer's [data binding helper element](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/templates.html), concretely a template repeater (`dom-repeat`):

```html
<dom-module id="beer-list">
  <template>  
    <style>
      /* CSS rules for your element */
    </style>
    <div class="beers">
      <template is="dom-repeat" items="{{beers}}">
        <beer-list-item name="{{item.name}}" description="{{item.description}}">
        </beer-list-item>
      </template>
    </div>
  </template>
</dom-module>
```

The template repeater is a specialized template that binds to an array. It creates one instance of the templateâ€™s contents for each item in the array. It adds two properties to the binding scope for each instance:

- `item`: The array item used to create this instance
- `index`: The index of item in the array

For more information about the template repeater, see the [Polymer documentation](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/templates.html#dom-repeat).

## Using the new element

In the `./src/pwa-app/pwa-app.html` file we aren't going to use directly `beer-list-item` elements anymore, but a simple `beer-list`. Let's replace the import of `beer-list-item` by an import of `beer-list`:

```html
<!-- Import `beer-list` element -->
<link rel="import" href="../beer-list/beer-list.html">
```

And use it inside the `main` case of the `iron-pages` section of `src/pwa-app/pwa-app.html` :

```html
  <iron-pages selected="[[page]]" attr-for-selected="name" fallback-selection="lost">
    <div name="main">
      <paper-toolbar>
        <div class="logo"><img src="/img/logo_bw-60px.png"></div>
        <div class="title">Beer list</div>
      </paper-toolbar>        
      <beer-list></beer-list>
    </div>
    <div name="bye"><h1>Beer details</h1></div>
    <div name="lost"><h1>It`s seem I'm lost...</h1></div>
  </iron-pages>
```


## Additional experiments

### Make the `beer-list` element show the number of beers in the list.

In the element's `dom-model` you have access to the beers variable, you can then get it's size and show it after the beers:

```html
<div>Number of beers in list: {{beers.length}}</div>
```

*Note: unlike precedent Polymer versions, Polymer 1.0 required the double curly-brake syntax (`{{}}`) to be used as the only element inside a DOM node. So the precedent line needed to be rewritten as `<div>Number of beers in list: <span>{{beers.length}}</span></div>`. This restriction was lifted on Polymer 1.2.*

### Play with `dom-repeat`

Create a repeater in `beer-list` that constructs a simple table:

```html
<table>
  <tr><th>Row number</th></tr>
  <template is="dom-repeat" items="[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]">
    <tr><td>{{item}}</td></tr>
  </template>
</table>
```

Extra points: try and make an 8x8 table using an additional `dom-repeat`.

*Note: To access properties from nested `dom-repeat` templates, use the `as` attribute to assign a different name for the item property. Use the `index-as` attribute to assign a different name for the `index` property.*
