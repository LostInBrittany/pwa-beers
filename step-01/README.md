# Step 01 - An empty application


## If Polymer CLI isn't installed

If you haven't Polymer CLI installed in your computer, you can still do most of the steps of this tutorial using the code of the respository. To do it, copy everything from the `step-01` folder (besides the `README.md`) into `app`. The `app` folder will be your working folder.
